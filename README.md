# Hi Saloni and team!

Hope this project finds you well.

Couple of important details about my build: 

* I decided to make a mock database as a ruby file. I hope that was okay, I just figured it would be easier for all of us than Postgres or Firebase.

* I know the instructions were clear about NOT adding any more files, but I have never been able to get rspec to run without at least a spec folder. I also felt that distributing the front end logic in a script file was important. Hope that was okay too! 

* I only added one extra gem on top of rspec, and that is uuid. I felt that represented best practices with any kind of database entry. 

## How to run this thing!

* cd into the main folder
* run ```ruby artists_songs_script```
* follow the prompted commands
* hit ```9``` to exit! 

### Thank you for this opportunity! 

Can't tell ya how excited I am to be interviewing with you. Hope to hear from you soon.

-Grant
